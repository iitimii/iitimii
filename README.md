## About Me

Iâ€™m a young researcher at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and control theory. My current focus is on combining model-based and learning-based control â€” not just to improve performance, but to build systems that understand the physical world.

Iâ€™m fascinated by phenomena like Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, Lyapunov theory, and even quantum mechanics. These are not just math tools to me; theyâ€™re clues to how intelligent systems should reason. I believe AGI will need strong dynamical priors **â€” not just data â€”** to truly grasp the world. To learn anything, an agent must predictâ€”and be changed by its prediction errors.

This belief drives my interest in unconventional ML approaches like dynamic and liquid neural networks, energy-based models, and predictive coding. General models like Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) can solve control problems. But I believe we're still scratching the surface. The best is ahead, and I want to be part of building it.

I plan to pursue a PhD after undergrad, to keep learning, building, and contributing to the path toward real-world intelligent systems.
