I’m Timilehin, a passionate young robotics developer deeply interested in how machines can learn and interact intelligently with both their environment and humans. Currently, I’m into reinforcement learning, focusing on its applications in robotics, especially in control. I've had the privilege of assisting researchers, which has fueled my desire to pursue a Master's and PhD. My ultimate goal is to lead groundbreaking robotics projects that make a real difference in improving global living standards through innovative research and development.
